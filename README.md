## ðŸš€ About Me

I specialize in **intelligent AI agents** and **multi-agent systems** using Python, LangChain, and advanced LLM frameworks. My work focuses on autonomous solutions, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and AI-driven IT operations.  

**Core Strengths:**  

- AI Agent Design & Orchestration (single & multi-agent systems)  
- LangChain & LLM Frameworks (OpenAI, AutoGen, Haystack)  
- RAG using vector databases (Pinecone, FAISS, Weaviate)  
- Autonomous IT Operations (self-healing workflows)  
- API Integration & External System Automation
